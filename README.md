# .NET Client for Azure Notification Hubs

This repository contains source code for Azure Notification Hubs .NET SDK as well as samples for using the client.  This library is also available via NuGet as part of [`Microsoft.Azure.NotificationHubs`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.NotificationHubs/).

## Building Code

To build the `Microsoft.Azure.NotificationHubs`, you need support for [.NET Standard 2.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard).  This requires a minimum of .NET Core 2.0, .NET Framework 4.6.1 or Mono 5.4.  This project ships with two unit test files, one for .NET Core 2.0, and one for .NET Framework 4.6.1 or Mono.
