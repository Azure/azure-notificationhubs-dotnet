This project samples browser push notification using Azure Notification Hub.

Setup “WebPushDemo” project to be able to use the browser as notification gateway. 
Open in visual studio and make sure framework 5.0 is installed. If you open project in VS2022, it will 
directly prompt you to install 5.0 if not found. Update “appsettings.json” by adding at end of file:
"VapidKeys": {
    "PublicKey": "vapid public key generated. To get one: https://www.attheminute.com/us/vapid-key-generator",
    "PrivateKey": "vapid private key generated. To get one: https://www.attheminute.com/us/vapid-key-generator"
  }

Running (F5) “WebPushDemo” will open browser with localhost:port#. You can add a device and send payload 
to the added device. Example using Edge, Click on “Add Device” once run successfully, 
it will provide the PushEndpoint, PushP256DH, and PushAuth.  
(Make sure  Edge browser “notifications” is enabled or add if needed the localhost:port# in the allow list)
